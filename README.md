# “✨ Welcome to Libft Ultra! “✨  

**Welcome to Libft Ultra, my evolving journey at 42 School!** 🎓  
This is a custom C library packed with useful functions that every C programmer will love. Libft Ultra started as an initial project but quickly grew into something even more special with the addition of personalized features and new implementations. ✨

## 📚 What is Libft Ultra?  
Libft Ultra is a collection of custom-built C functions and data structures. It began as an extension of the Libft project but went far beyond, incorporating advanced functions and programs that make C development even more practical and exciting. This library will continue to evolve as new features and updates are added to meet my changing needs.

Here’s what’s inside:  

### 📂 Core Functions  
- **String Manipulation**:  
  `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_substr`, and more.  
- **Memory Operations**:  
  `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_bzero`, and others.  
- **Character Checks**:  
  `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isprint`, and more.  
- **Data Conversion**:  
  `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, and other conversion functions.  
- **File Output**:  
  `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, and more.  

### ✉️ Bonus Features  
- **Linked Lists**:  
  Implementation of `t_list` and functions like `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstmap`, and more!  
- **File Reading**:  
  `get_next_line`, for easier line-by-line file reading.  
- **Custom Printing**:  
  `ft_printf`, an enhanced printing function, similar to `printf`, but with more control and features.  
- **Additional Programs**:  
  Custom implementations that are continually updated to include new functions and tools tailored to my coding needs.
